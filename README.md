1. Phase 1 is converting the c# scripts to clojure with lots of interop
2. Phase 2 will be making the code idiomatic
3. Phase 3 extending it to use @selfsame's tweening library for menus and pulsating enemies
4. Phase 4 writing the boss battle: space version of wacky waving inflatable arm flailing tube man
